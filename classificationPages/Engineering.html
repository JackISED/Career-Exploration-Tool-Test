<p class="paragraph">The Architecture, Engineering and Land Survey Group is about jobs that use scientific and professional knowledge in fields like architecture, landscape architecture, urban and rural planning, engineering, and land surveying. The main tasks in these jobs include:<br/>Planning, designing, building, or maintaining different systems or structures and creating engineering standards or procedures. This involves: <br/>Designing and taking care of buildings, transportation systems, telecommunications, utilities, or water projects. <br/>Services in environmental engineering like heating, air conditioning, or lighting. <br/>Engineering related to radio waves, product quality, industrial safety, or electrical utilities. <br/>Solving problems about air, water, or land pollution. e) Exploring sites and doing engineering surveys. <br/>Studies on cost-benefit or how feasible projects are. <br/>Creating physical systems or equipment for specific computer systems.<br/>Developing systems for land survey, mapping, charting, remote sensing technologies, satellite data, and managing geospatial data.<br/>Doing studies, analyzing information, and giving advice in these areas.<br/>Managing the sharing of technology in these activities.<br/>Leading any of these tasks.<br/>People in this group might also do research related to architecture, engineering, and land surveying.<br/>However, jobs that are mainly about basic research in natural sciences or that don't need a lot of knowledge in architecture, landscape architecture, urban and rural planning, engineering, and land surveying are not included in this group.<br/><br/></p>
